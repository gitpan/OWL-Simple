OWL-Simple

This package contains a set of modules to parse
an OWL ontology into a hash.

SCRIPTS

The similarity_match.pl compares a list of annotations to 
another ontology and suggests the best match based on some 
similarity metric (Levenshtein distance). It is also possible 
to align one ontology to another. Accepts ontologies in both
OBO and OWL formats as well as MeSH ASCII.

KNOWN ISSUES

Scripts were tested on UNIX. Correct loading of OWL ontologies 
can only be guaranteed if they were produced in Protege3.
